(i'm a database noob) I'm trying to get into databases but all of the learning materials I have start with using XAMPP to make a local server to learn. However, I can't figure out how a programmer makes the transition from local servers to "regular" servers on the web. For example, I have a very simple 1 & 1 account that has included databases I can use but I don't understand how to transition from learning XAMPP on a local server to using Javascript, MySQL, & PHP on databases My admin panel takes 1:00+ every time I click anything to load. I've searched and found several proposed solutions, but as far as I can tell, none are having any effect on the load times. The PC: 500 GB SSD 32 GB DDR4 RAM Intel i7 5820K CPU Any pointers in how to find the bottleneck.  Anybody know of a free http file server I can run on widows?? HTTP File Server has way to many bugs Easy File Sharing Web Server has a few bugs and it sucks. I am using WWW File Share Pro it but it is lacking a few features like limit download upload speed limit file types and allow more that one folder to upload to. Can anybody recommend a http file server that works on windows they everyone connect through web browser with a good amount of setting I am not looking for a ftp server. XAMPP is a really useful tool to learn how PHP and MySQL servers work, but I haven't come across anything similar to it for some of the newer web technologies out there. There's a lot of command-line shenanigans that have to happen to get RoR and Node.js running, and I was wondering if there was a better/graphically-oriented way to get a gem server/node.js instance running. It's not that I have anything against command-line tomfoolery, but I'd rather not have to learn different command so I am trying to install wamp, and before installation happens, it gives me a helpful warning on what I need to do befor installing. I took a screenshot of one section so it tells me to install WAMP in a folder at the root of the disk, but I dont know what that means or how to do it. its the only part of the warning that I dont get, everything else is straightforward. I'm running Windows 7. Any suggestions on the simplest way to do this are greatly appreciated. I am currently looking into adding some type of cloud storage and a simple HTTP website (think XAMPP with Wordpress-site) to my 2nd machine. It currently runs a Manjaro install I am looking to get rid of because I never could get it to work just perfect like my second install. My mint install - which today shares a few folders for backups etc via samba to windows 10 and runs a few games aswell as a terraria server. Would there be any point in installing a distro more aimed towards server-side.

I'm doing everything on my office workstation. I currently have SSMS & XAMPP installed and that's it. Once the App is ready I've been developing for awhile, but I am relatively new to contributing to a team. I'm having the most difficulty with creating my local development environment to match up with the same tools/versions that everyone else is using. In this particular example, I'm trying to setup my Windows 10 machine to clone a Wordpress project. I made the mistake of installing the latest versions of everything before realizing that the production version is still using PHP 5 (I installed 7), different versi. I write software for a living usually on my 7 monitor system in my office, but I also do a fair amount of international flights where I don't need to have all of the creature comforts, but I really want good battery life to code when inspiration hits me. I tried linux on my chromebook and it was a pain in the butt, but I was able to do some decent work on my last trip to China. I was willing to spend k USD on a new laptop, but it seems like the 0-0 ones have crappy batter. Hi r/sysadmin, When I started as a software dev in a large corporation a few weeks ago, it took nearly 3 weeks to get my workstation fully development ready. Infrastructure is unfortunately full of people who dont want to change, or choose not to explain why automating development kits isnt worth it. sysadmin work is a bit out of my league  but it seems with third party tools the automation would save alot of time. Vagrant, chocolatey, and boxstarter have come up more than once in research.

My proposal to boost adoption: make a Tor browser bundle with many added functionalities: Namecoin resolution, Zeronet integration, eth and neo domain resolution and DApps browser as well ( so, integration with ETH and NEO wallets as well, and possibly other ones like TRX ). Integration with I2P , etc. etc. A bundle will increase Zeronet userbase much more. Bundles are a great way to convince people to use a software. For example XAMPP has a great success because.
